Service Worker, as applied in this example, serve as a key tool to help implementing the idea of graceful degradation. User would not meet complete failure like not loading at all when offline, they would still have the preloaded info. So we could say, with service worker, the failure is more "graceful" rather than a complete disaster. It degrades to a graceful offline state instead of a crash.
